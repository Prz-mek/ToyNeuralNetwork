---

## demo
You can see a demo on [GitHub Pages](https://prz-mek.github.io/ToyNeuralNetwork/)

## goal
Creating website which visualize how simple neural network works. Better understanging how neural networks works.

## datasets
Neural networks are trainded on [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [The Digit Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-datasets-plot-digits-last-image-py) form scikit-learn.

## features
* neural network visualization
* 4 models of neural networks recognizing digits
* drawing simple bar chart
* user can draw digits for classification

(in progress)

## running
To run web site flask has to be installed:
```
python www_page/neuralnet_app.py
```

## todo

* improving  optimizer
